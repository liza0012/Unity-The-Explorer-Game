# Unity-The-Explorer-Game
The Explorer is a single player, 3d Action game made using Unity. It consists of 3 levels that have to be passed by the main character Ellen. Each level has some questions(Aptitude/IQ based) with 2 options out of which only one is correct. If the player chooses the correct answer they are treated with a health crate which restores health back but if they answer wrongly, the player is faced with a set of enemies. In order to fight the enemies one must find a sword, which will help them in all the further levels. Once all the questions are answered, the player has to explore the land and find a pressure pad that will lead them to the next level and explore new adventures
